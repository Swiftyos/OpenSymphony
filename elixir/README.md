# Symphony Elixir

This directory contains the current Elixir/OTP implementation of Symphony, based on
[`SPEC.md`](../SPEC.md) at the repository root.

> [!WARNING]
> Symphony Elixir is prototype software intended for evaluation only and is presented as-is.
> We recommend implementing your own hardened version based on `SPEC.md`.

## How it works

1. Polls Linear for candidate work
2. Creates a workspace per issue
3. Launches OpenCode in server mode inside the
   workspace
4. Sends a workflow prompt to OpenCode
5. Keeps OpenCode working on the issue until the work is done

During OpenCode sessions, Symphony also bootstraps a workspace-local `linear_graphql` custom tool
so that repo skills can make raw Linear GraphQL calls without storing secrets in the repo.

If a claimed issue moves to a terminal state (`Done`, `Closed`, `Cancelled`, or `Duplicate`),
Symphony stops the active agent for that issue and cleans up matching workspaces.

## How to use it

1. Make sure your codebase is set up to work well with agents: see
   [Harness engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/).
2. Get a new personal token in Linear via Settings → Security & access → Personal API keys, and
   set it as the `LINEAR_API_KEY` environment variable.
3. Copy this directory's `WORKFLOW.md` to your repo.
4. Optionally copy the `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `land`, and `linear` skills to your repo.
   - The `linear` skill expects Symphony's `linear_graphql` app-server tool for raw Linear GraphQL
     operations such as comment editing or upload flows.
5. Customize the copied `WORKFLOW.md` file for your project.
   - To get your project's slug, right-click the project and copy its URL. The slug is part of the
     URL.
   - When creating a workflow based on this repo, note that it depends on non-standard Linear
     issue statuses: "Rework", "Human Review", and "Merging". You can customize them in
     Team Settings → Workflow in Linear.
6. Follow the instructions below to install the required runtime dependencies and start the service.

## Prerequisites

We recommend using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage Elixir/Erlang versions.

```bash
mise install
mise exec -- elixir --version
```

## Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openai/symphony
cd symphony/elixir
mise trust
mise install
mise exec -- mix setup
mise exec -- mix build
mise exec -- ./bin/symphony ./WORKFLOW.md
```

## Configuration

Pass a custom workflow file path to `./bin/symphony` when starting the service:

```bash
./bin/symphony /path/to/custom/WORKFLOW.md
```

If no path is passed, Symphony defaults to `./WORKFLOW.md`.

Optional flags:

- `--logs-root` tells Symphony to write logs under a different directory (default: `./log`)
- `--port` also starts the Phoenix observability service (default: disabled)

The `WORKFLOW.md` file uses YAML front matter for configuration, plus a Markdown body used as the
OpenCode session prompt.

Minimal example:

```md
---
tracker:
  kind: linear
  project_slug: "..."
workspace:
  root: ~/code/workspaces
hooks:
  after_create: |
    git clone git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git .
agent:
  max_concurrent_agents: 10
  max_turns: 20
opencode:
  command: opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 0
---

You are working on a Linear issue {{ issue.identifier }}.

Title: {{ issue.title }} Body: {{ issue.description }}
```

Notes:

- If a value is missing, defaults are used.
- `opencode.command` defaults to `opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 0`.
- `opencode.agent` defaults to `build`.
- `opencode.model` is optional and must use `provider/model` format when set.
- `agent.max_turns` caps how many back-to-back OpenCode turns Symphony will run in a single agent
  invocation when a turn completes normally but the issue is still in an active state. Default: `20`.
- OpenCode v1 is local-only in Symphony. `worker.ssh_hosts` and
  `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` are rejected during config validation.
- OpenCode permissions are handled automatically for a limited unattended allowlist inside the
  issue workspace. Requests outside the workspace, `external_directory`, unknown permissions, and
  interactive questions are rejected.
- If the Markdown body is blank, Symphony uses a default prompt template that includes the issue
  identifier, title, and body.
- Use `hooks.after_create` to bootstrap a fresh workspace. For a Git-backed repo, you can run
  `git clone ... .` there, along with any other setup commands you need.
- If a hook needs `mise exec` inside a freshly cloned workspace, trust the repo config and fetch
  the project dependencies in `hooks.after_create` before invoking `mise` later from other hooks.
- `tracker.api_key` reads from `LINEAR_API_KEY` when unset or when value is `$LINEAR_API_KEY`.
- For path values, `~` is expanded to the home directory.
- For env-backed path values, use `$VAR`. `workspace.root` resolves `$VAR` before path handling,
  while `opencode.command` stays a shell command string and any `$VAR` expansion there happens in the
  launched shell.

```yaml
tracker:
  api_key: $LINEAR_API_KEY
workspace:
  root: $SYMPHONY_WORKSPACE_ROOT
hooks:
  after_create: |
    git clone --depth 1 "$SOURCE_REPO_URL" .
opencode:
  command: "$OPENCODE_BIN serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 0"
  agent: build
  model: openai/gpt-5.3
```

- If `WORKFLOW.md` is missing or has invalid YAML at startup, Symphony does not boot.
- If a later reload fails, Symphony keeps running with the last known good workflow and logs the
  reload error until the file is fixed.
- `server.port` or CLI `--port` enables the optional Phoenix LiveView dashboard and JSON API at
  `/`, `/api/v1/state`, `/api/v1/<issue_identifier>`, and `/api/v1/refresh`.

## Web dashboard

The observability UI now runs on a minimal Phoenix stack:

- LiveView for the dashboard at `/`
- JSON API for operational debugging under `/api/v1/*`
- Bandit as the HTTP server
- Phoenix dependency static assets for the LiveView client bootstrap

## Project Layout

- `lib/`: application code and Mix tasks
- `test/`: ExUnit coverage for runtime behavior
- `WORKFLOW.md`: in-repo workflow contract used by local runs
- `../.codex/`: repository-local skills and setup helpers used by the workflow

## Testing

```bash
make all
```

Run the real external end-to-end test only when you want Symphony to create disposable Linear
resources and launch a real `opencode serve --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 0` session:

```bash
cd elixir
export LINEAR_API_KEY=...
make e2e
```

Optional environment variables:

- `SYMPHONY_LIVE_LINEAR_TEAM_KEY` defaults to `SYME2E`

`make e2e` currently targets the local-only OpenCode flow.

The live test creates a temporary Linear project and issue, writes a temporary `WORKFLOW.md`, runs
a real agent turn, verifies the workspace side effect, requires OpenCode to comment on and close the
Linear issue, then marks the project completed so the run remains visible in Linear.

## FAQ

### Why Elixir?

Elixir is built on Erlang/BEAM/OTP, which is great for supervising long-running processes. It has an
active ecosystem of tools and libraries. It also supports hot code reloading without stopping
actively running subagents, which is very useful during development.

### What's the easiest way to set this up for my own codebase?

Launch OpenCode in your repo, give it the URL to the Symphony repo, and ask it to set things up
for you.
